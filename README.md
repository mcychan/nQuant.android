# nQuant.android

Fast pairwise nearest neighbor based algorithm producing high quality 256 color 8 bit PNG images minimizing color loss for photo having red lips and supports 256 or less colors with transparency. The time complexity of the method is O(N log N).
However, android does not support directly displaying bitmap in high color or indexed color format.

The demo android project is written in Java, using a button click to convert the sample image to 256 colors.<br/><br/>
